Hey there! I'm Marco, a 24-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast from Portugal. My journey in tech began as a systems administrator, where I worked across Linux and Windows environments, eventually reaching the senior level. From there, my curiosity and drive led me to dive deep into the world of pentesting, which is where I now focus my career.

I'm particularly passionate about web application security and infrastructure. Nothing quite matches the thrill of uncovering vulnerabilities and improving security for organizations.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying active at the gym, spending time with friends and family, and continuously learning about the latest techniques in pentesting. 
This blog is where I share my knowledge and experiences in pentesting, write-ups of CTF's, cert reviews, and bug bounty hunting (soon), and I hope you find something here to inspire and inform your own journey.
